Hey Byunghoon! 

You can directly make interfacial cells using POSCAR_Maker.ipynb jupyter notebook. But these will be of a certain size I used for my MD and interfacial energy calculations. 

If you want cells of different sizes you will have to edit the z-vector in the "Transformation_Vectors.pickle" corresponding to the interface you are interested in first. 

Then you will have to use Resource_Maker.py on these. These will output "Resources.pickle" files corresponding to the new structure dimensions in the interface folder.

These "Resources.pickle" are used to create the structure. POSCAR_Maker.ipynb uses these to make poscars.

"Resources.pickle" also contains information on Nearest Neighbors and Neighboring Octahedra lists for every octahedra. This information is not used in any of the codes I am sharing but may be useful in later parts of your project.

Let me know if you have questions!
